## Core Features:

- PDF Upload: Allows users to upload PDF documents to a central location.
- PDF Preview: Display PDF documents in a web-based viewer with page navigation.
- PDF Annotation: Users can add comments and annotations to specific sections of a PDF. A color scheme identifies who made which comments.
- User Mention: Users can tag other users in comments using the '@' symbol, notifying them of the comment.
- Comment Summary: Generate a summary report of all comments as a separate text file using AI as a tool to intelligently format and categorize feedback.
- Shareable Links: Share PDFs with annotations via a generated link, enabling view-only access.
- Export PDF: Enables exporting the annotated PDF as a flattened PDF (comments integrated into the document) and as a printable PDF (comments as marginal notes).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a muted blue (#6699CC) to give a sense of calm and professionalism, nodding to the seriousness of document collaboration but remaining modern.
- Background color: A very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) provides a clean backdrop that doesn't distract from the document content.
- Accent color: Opt for a subtle lavender (#9966CC) to highlight interactive elements without overwhelming the primary palette.
- Font pairing: Use 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headers to convey personality, combined with 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text to improve readability in longer comments and documents.
- Employ a set of minimalistic icons to represent common actions like commenting, sharing, and exporting.
- Adopt a clean and spacious layout to prevent clutter, focusing on the PDF document as the central element.
- Incorporate subtle animations for comment expansions and page transitions to give a modern feel.
